Six O
epidemiologic O

indicate O
that O

As O

North O

West O
Berlin O
, O
Germany O
, O
showed O
that O
habitual O

also O
associated O
with O
chronic B-disease

risk O
in O
the O

These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
both O
phenacetin B-chem

acetaminophen B-chem
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
burden O
of O
ESRD B-disease

with O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
latter O
being O
somewhat O
less O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O
. O

This O
apparent O
difference O
in O
risk O
may O
not O
be O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
nephrotoxic B-disease
potential O
of O
the O
drugs O
themselves O
. O

A O
lower O
relative O
risk O
would O
be O
expected O
for O
acetaminophen B-chem
if O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
drugs O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
risk O
of O
either O
agent O
alone O
. O

Thus O
, O
acetaminophen B-chem
has O
been O
used O
both O
as O
a O
single O
agent O
and O
in O

with O
other O
analgesics O
, O
whereas O
phenacetin B-chem
was O
available O
only O
in O
combinations O
. O

The O
possibility O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen B-chem
alone O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
ESRD B-disease
has O
not O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated O
, O
but O
can O

However O
, O
tAMCA B-chem

been O
shown O
to O
cause O
epileptic B-disease

We O
wanted O
to O
study O
whether O

its O

METHOD O
: O

The O

FINDINGS O
: O

The O
degree O
of O
these O

increased O
with O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O

Prilocaine B-chem
may O
be O
preferable O
to O
lidocaine B-chem
for O
short O
surgical O
procedures O
because O
it O
has O
a O
similar O
duration O

a O
lower O
incidence O

The O
role O
of O
nicotine B-chem
in O
smoking O
- O
related O
cardiovascular B-disease
disease I-disease
. O

Nicotine B-chem
activates O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
and O
in O
this O
way O
could O
contribute O
to O
cardiovascular B-disease
disease I-disease
. O

Animal O
studies O
and O
mechanistic O
studies O
indicate O
that O
nicotine B-chem
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
accelerating O
atherosclerosis B-disease
, O
but O
evidence O
among O
humans O
is O
too O
inadequate O
to O
be O
definitive O
about O
such O
an O
effect O
. O

Almost O
certainly O
, O
nicotine B-chem
via O
its O
hemodynamic O
effects O
contributes O
to O
acute O
cardiovascular O
events O
, O
although O
current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine B-chem
are O
much O
less O
important O
than O
are O
the O
prothrombotic O
effects O
of O
cigarette O
smoking O
or O
the O
effects O
of O
carbon B-chem
monoxide I-chem
. O

Nicotine B-chem
does O
not O
appear O
to O
enhance O
thrombosis B-disease
among O
humans O
. O

Clinical O
studies O
of O
pipe O
smokers O
and O
people O
using O
transdermal O
nicotine B-chem
support O
the O
idea O
that O
toxins O
other O
than O
nicotine B-chem
are O
the O
most O
important O
causes O
of O
acute O

. O

Finally O
, O
the O
dose O
response O
for O
cardiovascular O
events O
of O
nicotine B-chem
appears O
to O
be O
flat O

that O
if O

that O

we O

that O

However O
, O
one O
drawback O
of O

the O
fact O
that O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O

The O
data O

indicate O
that O

an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
compensation O

Because O
such O
a O

occurs O
to O
reduce O

the O

a O
protective O
role O

BACKGROUND O
/ O
AIMS O
: O

Recently O
ribavirin B-chem

been O
found O
to O
inhibit O
angiogenesis O
and O
a O
number O
of O
angiogenesis O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
sunitinib B-chem
and O
sorafenib B-chem
have O
been O
found O
to O
cause O
acute O
hemolysis B-disease
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
whether O
there O
is O
a O
relation O
between O
hemoglobin O
, O
haptoglobin O
and O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
which O
are O
modifiable O
and O
can O
help O

METHODS O
: O

Fourteen O

were O
treated O
by O

were O
investigated O

RESULTS O
: O

We O
observed O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
haptoglobin O
levels O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
treatment O
period O
. O

Hemoglobin O
levels O
also O
decreased O

insignificantly O
by O

. O

In O
contrast O
with O
the O
literature O
, O
serum O
levels O
of O

factors O
did O
not O
change O
significantly O
by O
pegylated B-chem
interferon I-chem
and O
ribavirin B-chem
therapy O
. O

We O
found O
no O
correlation O

markers O
with O
either O
hemoglobin O

haptoglobin O

as O
the O
infusion O

stopped O
and O
the O

. O

The O

included O

, O
hydroxyzine B-chem
, O
promethazine B-chem
, O
hydrocortisone B-chem
, O
and O
prochlorperazine B-chem
. O

Despite O
administration O
of O
phenytoin B-chem

lorazepam B-chem
, O
the O
seizures B-disease
persisted O
and O
occurred O
only O
during O

DISCUSSION O
: O

cryptococcal B-disease
meningitis I-disease
, O
both O
of O
which O
the O
patient O
had O
, O
can O
potentially O
cause O
seizures B-disease
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
history O
of O
alcohol B-disease
abuse I-disease
; O
alcohol B-chem
intake O
as O
well O
as O

can O
also O
cause O
seizures B-disease
. O

Didanosine B-chem
also O
has O
a O
potential O
for O
inducing O
seizures B-disease
. O

However O
, O
these O
other O
potential O
causes O
of O

ruled O
out O

The O

the O
cause O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O

Amphotericin B-chem

Hemorrhagic B-disease
cystitis I-disease
is O
a O
major O
potential O
toxicity B-disease

that O
can O
be O
prevented O
by O
administering O
mesna B-chem

the O
cytotoxic O

. O

Mesna B-chem
is O
generally O
administered O
by O
the O
intravenous O
route O
, O
although O
experience O
with O
oral O
delivery O
of O
the O
drug O
has O
increased O
. O

The O
continuous O
subcutaneous O
administration O
of O
mesna B-chem
has O
the O
advantage O
of O
not O

In O

, O
subcutaneous O

Limited O

it O
is O
a O
safe O

Tacrolimus B-chem
is O
a O
potent O
immunosuppressant O
that O
is O
frequently O
used O
in O
organ O

. O

However O
, O
adverse O
effects O
include O
cardiac B-disease

Herein O
we O
describe O
transient O
myocardial B-disease
hypertrophy I-disease
induced O
by O
tacrolimus B-chem
after O
heart O
transplantation O
. O

The O
hypertrophy B-disease
caused O
no O
clinical O
symptoms O
but O
was O
noted O
because O
of O
elevation O
of O
plasma O
brain O
natriuretic O
peptide O
concentration O
and O
confirmed O
at O

Initially O
, O
allograft O
rejection O
was O
feared O
; O
however O
, O
myocardial O
biopsy O

revealed O
only O
interstitial O

mild O
myocardial B-disease
hypertrophy I-disease
; O
neither O
cellular O
nor O
humoral O
rejection O
was O
detected O
. O

The O
blood O
tacrolimus B-chem
concentration O
was O
higher O
than O
usual O
at O
that O
time O
; O
thus O
, O
tacrolimus B-chem
dosage O
was O
reduced O
. O

Myocardial B-disease
hypertrophy I-disease
completely O
resolved O
upon O
reducing O
the O
target O
concentration O
of O
tacrolimus B-chem

did O
not O
recur O
, O
as O
confirmed O
at O

and O
myocardial O

Thus O
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
tacrolimus B-chem
induces O

. O

In O

These O

be O
of O
use O
in O
the O
management O

the O

Early O
identification O

BACKGROUND O
: O
In O
recent O
studies O
increased O
amounts O
of O
nitric B-chem
oxide I-chem
( O
NO B-chem
) O
and O

have O
been O
implicated O
in O
various O
pathological O
conditions O
in O
the O
kidney O
. O

We O
have O
studied O
the O
role O
of O
NO B-chem
and O
its O
association O
with O
apoptosis O
in O
an O
experimental O
model O
of O

METHODS O
: O

The O
alteration O
in O
the O
NO B-chem
pathway O
was O
assessed O
by O
measuring O
nitrite B-chem
levels O
in O
serum O
/ O
urine O
and O
by O
evaluating O
the O
changes O
in O
vascular O
reactivity O
of O
the O
isolated O
perfused O
rat O
kidney O
( O
IPRK O
) O
system O
. O

Rats O
were O
stratified O
into O
control O
groups O
and O
ADR B-chem

groups O
. O

These O
two O
groups O
were O
then O
divided O
into O
: O
group O
1 O
, O
animals O
receiving O

and O
group O
2 O
, O
animals O
receiving O
aminoguanidine B-chem
( O

) O
which O
is O
a O
specific O
inhibitor O
of O

. O

On O
day O

RESULTS O
: O

Histopathological O
examination O
of O
the O
kidneys O
of O
rats O
treated O

revealed O
focal O
areas O

. O

They O
also O
had O
significantly O
higher O

( O

Urine O

. O

In O
the O
IPRK O
phenylephrine B-chem
and O
acetylcholine B-chem
related O
responses O
were O
significantly O
impaired O
in O
the O
ADR B-chem
- O
nephropathy B-disease
group O
. O

Apoptosis O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
controls O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
ADR B-chem
- O
nephropathy B-disease
group O
, O
numerous O
apoptotic O
cells O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
tubulointerstitial O
areas O
. O

Double O

revealed O
numerous O
interstitial O
apoptotic O
cells O
to O

for O
ED1 O
, O
a O

Treatment O
with O
AG B-chem
prevented O
the O
impairment O
of O
renal O
vascular O

responses O
and O
reduced O
both O
urine O
nitrite B-chem
levels O

CONCLUSION O
: O

We O
suggest O
that O
interactions O
between O
NO B-chem
and O
apoptosis O
are O
important O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O

Therefore O

, O
inhibited O
the O

. O

The O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
carteolol B-chem
was O
almost O
comparable O
to O
that O

but O
was O
