0	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Centrosomes increase both in size and in microtubule-nucleating capacity just before mitotic entry.	Functional studies showed that, when introduced into cell lines, miR-146a was found to promote cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells, which suggests that miR-146a works as an oncogenic miRNA in these cancers.	0.0
1	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Third, human Wts2 is a phosphorylation target of Aurora-A kinase, and this phosphorylation plays a role in regulating centrosomal localization of hWts2 ( Toji et al., 2004)	Similarly to PLK1, Aurora-A activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation, including LATS2 [ 22] and CDK5RAP2/Cnn [ 23] (see [ 10] for a review)	1.2
2	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	expression of an activated form of Ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts.	When expressed alone in primary cells however, oncogenic Ras induces premature senescence, a putative tumour suppressor mechanism to protect from uncontrolled proliferation.	3.0
3	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Besides these 28 OCT4-regulated genes, the Oct4-OETN included 8 more genes of a recently published list of OCT4-correlated transcripts expressed in ESCs.	Almost half (37) of the Oct4-OETN genes are known Oct4 companions in ESCs, as their expression is directly regulated by or correlated with Oct4.	2.8
4	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	miR-Vec constructs were described before, and Dnd1 open-reading frames were cloned as described into a pCS2-based CMV expression vector to contain a double carboxy-terminal HA tag.	The pMSCV-blast-miR plasmids, containing either hsa-miR-376a1 human miRNA or control miRNA (hTR-human telomerase RNA), were constructed as described previously.	1.0
5	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Accordingly, expression of mutant K-Ras alone is sufficient to drive malignant progression, whereas elimination of mutant K-Ras from established tumors leads to tumor regression.	the results of research  represent a very important advance in the long-standing fight to conquer lung cancer.	0.2
6	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In a previous study in a mouse model of KRas-dependent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, it was shown that oncogenic KRas induces nucleotide biosynthesis largely through the enhancement of the nonoxidative branch of the PPP.	Previous results showed that oncogenic Ras elevates ribonucleotide synthesis largely through the nonoxidative branch of the PPP.	3.2
7	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	The up-regulation of miR-146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues.	Similarly to PLK1, Aurora-A activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation, including LATS2 and CDK5RAP2/Cnn.	0.2
8	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Oncogenic KRAS mutations are common in cancer.	Notably, c-Raf has recently been found essential for development of K-Ras-driven NSCLCs.	1.8
9	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα)	There is growing evidence from animal systems that miRNA-regulated transcription factors frequently regulate the transcription of their cognate miRNAs.	1.8
10	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Importantly, RNAi knockdown of Gfpt1 reduced overall O-GlcNAcylation and blocked KrasG12DA-mediated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.	GFPT1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the HBP and it has been identified as an important contributor to Kras-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)	2.2
11	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Necroptosis is also part of host defense against virus infection.	Necrotic death was augmented when caspase activities were compromised by either viral or chemical inhibitors.	2.0
12	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	GATA2 is also of considerable interest; genetic ablation leads to tumor regression in mouse models of adenocarcinoma of the lung, and whereas this transcription factor may appear to be the least druggable of targets, its role in regulating the proteasome suggested therapeutic approaches that appear very promising	The GATA2 transcription factor, which is essential for oncogenic K-ras-dependent lung tumor development, binds to the TRAF6 promoter and enhances its expression.	1.8
13	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	A high percentage of tumor cells that take on immortalized characteristics show telomerase activity and it has been suggested that hTERT expression may be one of the six key events common to cancer.	As a serine/threonine protein kinase, AKT functions by phosphorylating key intermediate signaling molecules, leading to increased cell metabolism, cell growth, cell survival, and cell invasiveness—all hallmarks of cancer.	1.4
14	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	The researchers screened human NSCLC cell lines carrying either wild-type or mutant KRAS with an RNAi library against 7,000 human genes.	Recently, it was shown that Gata2 fulfills such role in mutant Kras induced NSCLC.	1.8
15	GENRE	filename	1997	1	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	The Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces regression of solid tumors  and its derivatives are in the early clinical phase as cancer therapeutics; however, it targets Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1, which induces resistance against apoptotic cell death triggered by ABT-737.	Recently, it has been reported that ABT-737 is not cytotoxic to all tumors cells, and that chemoresistance to ABT-737 is dependent on appreciable levels of Mcl-1 expression, the one Bcl-2 family member it does not effectively inhibit.	3.0
